# Integration Testing Guide - Food Delivery App

## 1. Project Overview

This is a **Food Delivery Application** with the following architecture:

### 1.1 Technology Stack

**Backend:**

- Node.js + Express.js

## 2. Backend API Integration Tests

### 2.1 Current Test Structure

The backend already has a comprehensive integration test suite:

```
BackEnd/
├── tests/
│   └── integration/
│       ├── auth.integration.test.js     # Authentication API tests
│       ├── shop.integration.test.js     # Shop management API tests
│       └── models.integration.test.js   # Database model tests
├── package.json                         # Test scripts configuration
└── jest.config.js                      # Jest configuration
```

### 2.2 Test Environment Setup

The project uses **Jest** with **MongoDB Memory Server** for isolated testing:

```javascript
// Current setup in tests/integration/
import dotenv from "dotenv";
import mongoose from "mongoose";
import { MongoMemoryServer } from "mongodb-memory-server";

// Load test environment variables
dotenv.config({ path: ".env.test" });

let mongod;

beforeAll(async () => {
  mongod = await MongoMemoryServer.create();
  const uri = mongod.getUri();
  await mongoose.connect(uri);
});

afterAll(async () => {
  await mongoose.connection.dropDatabase();
  await mongoose.connection.close();
  await mongod.stop();
});
```

### 2.3 Current Integration Test Coverage

**Shop Management Tests** (`shop.integration.test.js`):

- ✅ Get shops by city
- ✅ Get shop owner's shop
- ✅ Create/edit shop (owner only)
- ✅ Authentication requirements
- ✅ Role-based access control

**Database Model Tests** (`models.integration.test.js`):

- ✅ User-Shop relationships

- ✅ Complex aggregation queries

### 2.4 Running Backend Tests

```bash
cd BackEnd

# Run all integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run specific test file
npm test tests/integration/auth.integration.test.js

# Run with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Current test results (as of latest run):
# ✅ Test Suites: 3 passed, 3 total
# ✅ Tests: 17 passed, 17 total
# ✅ All integration tests passing
```

## 3. Frontend Integration Tests

### 3.1 Current Frontend Test Structure

The frontend uses **Vitest** for testing with React Testing Library:

```
FrontEnd/
├── src/
│   └── components/
│       └── __tests__/
│           ├── LoginForm.test.jsx        # Login form component tests
│           └── ShopList.test.jsx         # Shop list component tests
├── package.json                          # Test scripts with Vitest
├── vite.config.js                       # Vite + Vitest configuration
└── vitest.config.js                     # Vitest specific config
```

### 3.2 Current Frontend Test Coverage

**Component Tests** (`LoginForm.test.jsx`):

- ✅ Form submission with valid data
- ✅ Error message display on login failure
- ✅ Loading state during submission
- ✅ Form validation
- ✅ User interaction handling

**Component Tests** (`ShopList.test.jsx`):

- ✅ Shop list rendering
- ✅ Empty state handling
- ✅ Shop item display
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Error handling

### 3.3 Running Frontend Tests

```bash
cd FrontEnd

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:ui

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Current test results (as of latest run):
# ✅ Test Files: 2 passed, 2 total
# ✅ Tests: 10 passed, 10 total
# ✅ All frontend tests passing
```

### 3.4 Frontend Testing Architecture

The frontend testing follows these patterns:

**Component Testing:**

- Uses React Testing Library for DOM testing
- Mocks external dependencies (APIs, services)
- Tests user interactions and component behavior
- Validates rendering and state changes

**Integration Testing Approach:**

- Tests component + Redux store integration
- Mocks API calls with MSW (Mock Service Worker)
- Tests complete user workflows
- Validates data flow between components

## 4. Project-Specific Test Scenarios

### 4.1 Food Delivery App Test Cases

**User Authentication Flow:**

```bash
# Backend: Authentication API
✅ POST /api/auth/register - User registration
✅ POST /api/auth/login - User login
✅ POST /api/auth/logout - User logout
✅ JWT token validation middleware

# Frontend: Login/Register Components
✅ Form validation and submission
✅ Error handling and display
✅ Loading states during API calls
✅ Successful authentication redirect
```

**Shop Management Flow:**

```bash
# Backend: Shop API
✅ GET /api/shop/get-by-city/:city - Find shops by location
✅ GET /api/shop/get-my - Owner's shop management
✅ POST /api/shop/create-edit - Create/update shop
✅ Role-based access control (owner only)

# Frontend: Shop Components
✅ Shop list display and filtering
✅ Shop creation/editing forms
✅ Location-based shop search
✅ Owner dashboard functionality
```

**Database Relationships:**

```bash
# Model Integration Tests
✅ User ↔ Shop relationship (owner)
✅ Shop ↔ Item relationship (menu items)
✅ Order ↔ User/Shop relationships
✅ Referential integrity enforcement
✅ Complex aggregation queries
```
